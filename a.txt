software architect

design plan for new programs
domain expert, software arch (UML), soft designer (data store, sec), soft dev

feature driven design:
1. fonction specification
OOA: abstraction classification (big terms that will be manipulated)
Can a Room/Teacher be assigned to a Course ?
=> missing Abstraction, Section
scheduling conflicts ?
=> each assigned their own Schedule
Prerequisite is a Course ?
=> No, asvisory or mandatory, what if it is "prior experience"
=> New Data Struct
2. Conceptual class diagram (1:N:1)
OOA: Behaviour
Determine relationship between classes (UML)
teacher:1-1:schedule
teacher:1-N:section
student:N-N:section => need a new Thing (Seat/ReportCard)
3. Use cases
OOD relationships
attributes, class
encapsulation (API, object service, and implementation)
4. Sequence flows, crc, .h templates
OOD/OOP Physical mapping
5. Security, database, packaging, connections
message broker (middleware)
or common database
